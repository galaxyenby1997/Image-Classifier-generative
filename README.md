# Image-Classifier-generative
creating a AI image classifier with generative models

In this code I am creating an image classifier of handwriten digits from MNIST which uses generative models. 
Basically for each digit, the AI system creates a "mental model" (a generative model) and makes classification decisions
with an if-else statement by comparing new, unseen test images to each model. If you want to learn more about the project,
